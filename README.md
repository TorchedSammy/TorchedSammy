### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!
My name is Sammy, a pansexual weeb that likes playing games and programming. I am also trying to do drawing and writing on the side.
I am mainly a Node.js developer but I know other languages (like Dart, Rust, Go) and hopefully I can get away from being a JavaScript 1 trick.  
Be sure to look at my pinned (aka best) projects below.  
I've used and/or have experience in these languages: Node.js, HTML, CSS, AutoHotKey, Lua, Crystal, Rust, Go, Dart, Python, BASIC, Java, C#  
And you might be wondering how do I still only mainly use Node.js when I know all these languages?  
- I know it best, so making projects is easier
- More popular than others like Dart, Go or Crystal

I am also looking for decently competent developers to join [Kirb Inc.](https://github.com/KirbInc) to make fun and cool projects.
