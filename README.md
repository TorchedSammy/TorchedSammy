<p>⇢ <i>Info</i></p>

Hobbyist software developer. Been programming for almost 6 years, and making user-facing software for half that time.  
I mostly use Go or Lua. I like making things purely for fun or what's useful for me.  
[Selene] is an example of a project for fun, [Mori] is for my use.

<p>⇢ <i>Interests</i></p>

I like playing games. You can join my Discord community and talk to me about games like Stardew Valley, OpenTTD,
SimCity 4, or Minecraft. I'm willing to play anything free and runs on my laptop.

I watch Anime and Dramas if I'm not programming most of the time. I enjoy mainly romance anime, but basically anything goes.
For dramas, anything as well. I have a MyAnimeList profile linked on my website, and here's [MyDramaList].

Music is nice. I listen to music almost everyday. Eventually I'll get to making music as well.

Sometimes I doodle in my very bored free time. I can draw small and simple things.
