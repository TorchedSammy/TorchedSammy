### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!
My name is Sammy, a pansexual weeb that likes playing games and programming. I am also trying to do drawing and writing on the side.
I am mainly a Node.js developer but I use others like Dart and Rust. Here is a full list of those ive used: Node.js, HTML, CSS, AutoHotKey, Lua, Crystal, Rust, Go, Dart, Python, BASIC, Java, C#  
Node.js will probably stay my main language since I know it best.

I am also looking for developers to join [Luvella](https://github.com/Luvella) in hopes to make useful software and packages.
